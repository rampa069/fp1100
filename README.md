# Casio FP-1100 / FP-1000 for MiST-family FPGA boards

*[Leer en español](README_es.md)*

An FPGA implementation of the **Casio FP-1100** (1982) and its monochrome
sibling, the **FP-1000**, for the **Poseidon**, **SiDi** and **Calypso**
boards. It runs the original ROMs on both of the machine's processors and
boots C82-BASIC and CP/M from EDSK disk images.

## Features

- **Main CPU**: Z80 at 4 MHz (T80) from a 32 MHz system clock; the BASIC ROM
  and the 64K of RAM live in SDRAM, with the CPU stalled only when it
  actually needs data that the SDRAM has not delivered yet.
- **Sub CPU**: the NEC uPD7801 that runs the keyboard, video, cassette and
  printer, emulated on a uPD7800 core with the original internal ROM,
  talking to the Z80 through the same latches and interrupt lines.
- **Video**: HD46505 CRTC and the three-plane colour VRAM (48K, in SDRAM),
  read one line ahead into a line buffer. 80 and 40 columns, 640x200 in
  eight colours, the green-monitor mode of the FP-1000, and **Screen 1**
  (640x400 interlaced): shown either as alternating fields or, by default,
  as a full 640x400 progressive picture with the core's own 31 kHz output.
- **Keyboard**: PS/2 to the FP-1100 key matrix, with protection against
  keys left pressed when the firmware loses a key release.
- **Cassette**: WAV files from the OSD or real audio on the audio input,
  with a tape monitor to hear what is loading.
- **Disk**: the FDC pack (uPD765) with EDSK images in drives A and B; CP/M
  boots from disk.
- **Tools**: WAV/CAS/TZX/TAP tape converter, disk image converters (D88,
  Teledisk, ImageDisk and raw dumps to EDSK), a uPD7801 disassembler and a
  monitor test card on a self-booting disk.

**ROMs are not included.** They are copyright of Casio and have to be
supplied by the user; see `roms/README.md` for the expected `FP1100.ROM`.

## How it works

**Two processors, as in the real machine.** The FP-1100 splits its work
between a Z80, which runs BASIC, and a uPD7801 that owns the keyboard, the
video memory, the cassette circuit and the printer port. The core keeps that
split: the T80 runs the BASIC ROM from SDRAM, and the uPD7800 core runs the
sub CPU's internal ROM from block RAM. They talk through the original
latches and interrupt lines, and every BASIC command that draws on the
screen or reads the keyboard goes through the sub CPU's own firmware.

**Memory.** ROM, RAM and the colour VRAM share one SDRAM. A fixed-priority
arbiter serves refresh, video, tape and the CPUs. The video reads two words
per character with a single ACTIVE; the Z80 is only held back at the exact
point where it would sample the data bus.

**Video.** Instead of reading the VRAM at the dot clock, the core reads each
CRTC line into a line buffer during the previous line, which makes an SDRAM
VRAM possible on boards with little block RAM. The dot clock is exactly 25/32
of the system clock, so each line is 800 dots of 12.5 MHz (64 us) and the
scandoubled output is standard 640x480 VGA timing.

**Cassette.** The FSK demodulator reproduces the machine's own circuit, and
a player module streams WAV files loaded from the OSD as if they came from a
tape deck under motor control.

**Testing.** The whole machine runs in a Verilator testbench with the real
ROMs: booting BASIC, typing, loading tapes and disks, CP/M, and the games
used to chase timing problems. See `docs/hardware_fp1100.md` for the
development notes.

## Building

Open the project for your board in Quartus (`poseidon/`, `sidi/` or
`calypso/`) and compile. The testbenches run with `make` in `test/`.
The documentation in `docs/` is in Spanish.

`common/` contains copies of T80 and mist-modules with two small local
changes (a cold-start fix in `T80pa.vhd` and a configurable PS/2 queue in
`user_io.v`), so they are included as plain folders rather than submodules.
